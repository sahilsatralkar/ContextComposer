## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Foundation Models API not available on the Simulator"**
- Solution: The app requires a physical device with Apple Intelligence. The iOS Simulator does not support Foundation Models API. Test on iPhone 15 Pro or later.

**"Apple Intelligence not available"**
- Solution: Go to Settings ‚Üí Apple Intelligence & Siri ‚Üí Enable Apple Intelligence

**"Model failed to initialize"**
- Solution: Restart your device and ensure you have at least 1GB free storage

**"Generation takes too long"**
- Solution: Close other apps to free up memory, try shorter input text

**"App crashes on launch"**
- Solution: Ensure you're running iOS 26+ on a compatible device

**"Input text is too long"**
- Solution: The model has a 4,096 token limit. Try shortening your input text.
